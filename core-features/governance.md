# üèõ Governance

**Governance of Minerva**\
\
Governance on Minerva is conducted through a voting system, where holders of MINE / allMINE tokens can vote on community proposals that determine the direction of the platform.\
\
**Voting with MINE Tokens**\
\
To participate in voting on Minerva, users must hold MINE / allMINE tokens. These tokens are an illiquid version of the MINE tokens that accrue additional MINE tokens through yield-bearing mechanisms. Once a user holds MINE / allMINE tokens, they can vote on proposals through the Snapshot platform.\
\
**The More You Hold, The More You Can Vote**\
\
The weight of a user's vote is determined by the amount of MINE / allMINE tokens they hold. The more allMINE tokens a user holds, the more voting power they have. Additionally, since MINE / allMINE tokens accrue more MINE / allMINE tokens, this incentivizes users to hold onto their bMINE tokens for an extended period of time, as they will accumulate more MINE tokens over time, thus giving them more voting power. Users can convert their bMINE to MINE at any time, but doing so would decrease the number of bMINE tokens they hold, thus decreasing their voting power.\
\
**Voting on Community Proposals**\
\
Community proposals are submitted by users of the platform and can cover a wide range of topics, such as new features, changes to the platform's economics, and more. Users can vote on proposals through the Snapshot platform. The proposal will be implemented if it reaches a certain level of support from the community. This ensures that the direction of the platform is determined by the community and not by a small group of individuals.\
\
In summary, the governance of Minerva is conducted through a voting system where holders of dSKULL tokens can vote on community proposals that determine the direction of the platform. The weight of a user's vote is determined by the amount of bMINE tokens they hold, and since bMINE tokens accrue more MINE tokens, it incentivizes users to hold onto their bMINE tokens for an extended period of time, thus giving them more voting power.
