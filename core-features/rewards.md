# üí∞ Rewards

### Compounding vs Claiming

There are two options for rewards on [https://minerva.money](https://minerva.money): "Compound" and "Claim".\
\
Compounding will stake your pending Multiplier Points and Escrowed MINE rewards, this will increase the amount of rewards you receive.\
\
Claiming will transfer any pending Escrowed MINE (allMINE) rewards and ETH rewards to your wallet.\
\
If you compound or stake your Escrowed MINE (allMINE) tokens, you can unstake them for vesting at anytime later on.

### Escrowed MINE (allMINE)

Escrowed MINE (allMINE) can be used in two ways:\
\
1\. Staked for rewards similar to regular MINE tokens.\
2\. Vested to become actual MINE tokens over a period of one year\
\
Each staked Escrowed MINE (allMINE) token will earn the same amount of Escrowed MINE and ETH rewards as a regular MINE token.\
\
Note that Escrowed MINE (allMINE) is not meant to be transferrable unless you are doing a full account transfer. The amount of MINE or MLP required to vest allMINE is unique per account and capped to the rewards received by that account. Please do not buy allMINE off the market or OTC as you will not be able to vest them.

### Vesting

Escrowed MINE (allMINE) tokens can be converted into MINE tokens through vesting, this can be accessed on the Earn page.\
\
When vesting is initiated, the average amount of MINE or MLP tokens that was used to earn the allMINE rewards will be reserved.\
\
For example, if you staked 1000 MINE and earned 100 allMINE tokens, then to vest 100 allMINE tokens, 1000 MINE tokens will be reserved. To vest 50 allMINE, 500 MINE tokens will be reserved. Note that this is an example and the actual ratio depends on the average staked amount and rewards earned for your account.\
\
allMINE tokens that have been unstaked and deposited for vesting will not earn rewards. Staked tokens that are reserved for vesting will continue to earn rewards.\
\
After initiating vesting, the allMINE tokens will be converted into MINE every second and will fully vest over 365 days. allMINE tokens that have been converted into MINE are claimable at anytime.\
\
If a user sells MINE or MLP tokens and would like to vest their allMINE rewards later on, they would need to re-buy the MINE or MLP tokens. MINE, allMINE and Multiplier Points can be used interchangeably for the required reserve amount.\
\
Depositing into the vesting vault while existing vesting is ongoing is supported.\
\
Tokens that are reserved for vesting cannot be unstaked or sold. To unreserve the tokens, use the "Withdraw" button on the Earn page. Partial withdrawals are not supported, so withdrawing will withdraw and unreserve all tokens as well as pause vesting. All escrowed MINE (allMINE) tokens that had been vested into MINE will remain as MINE tokens.

## Multiplier Points

Multiplier Points reward long term holders without inflation.\
\
When you stake MINE, you receive Multiplier Points every second at a fixed rate of 100% APR. 1000 MINE staked for one year would earn 1000 Multiplier Points.\
\
Multiplier points can be staked for fee rewards by pressing the "Compound" button on the Earn page, each multiplier point will boost ETH APRs at the same rate as a regular MINE token.\
\
When MINE or Escrowed MINE (allMINE) tokens are unstaked, the proportional amount of Multiplier Points are burnt. For example, if 1000 MINE is staked and 500 Multiplier Points have been earned so far, then unstaking 300 MINE would burn 150 (300 / 1000 \* 500) Multiplier Points. The burn will apply to the total amount of Multiplier Points which includes both staked and unstaked Multiplier Points.\
\
To transfer staked tokens without burning Multiplier Points, use the Transfer button on[ https://minerva.money/#/earn](https://minerva.money/#/earn).\
\
The "Boost Percentage" shown on the Earn page shows your individual boost amount from Multiplier Points. For example, if the ETH APR is 10% and you have $10,000 worth of MINE and allMINE, then your rewards would be $1000 annualized, if you additionally have an amount of Multiplier Points equivalent to 20% of your total amount of MINE and Escrowed MINE, your "Boost Percentage" would display as 20%, and you would get an extra $200 of ETH rewards annualized. The ‚ÄúBoost Percentage‚Äù is calculated from the ratio of Multiplier Points to your total amount of staked MINE:\


{% hint style="info" %}
**Boost Percentage = 100 \* (Staked Multiplier Points) / (Staked MINE + Staked allMINE)**
{% endhint %}

### Distribution Rate

Escrowed MINE will be distributed to staked MINE and MLP according to the schedule in the latest snapshot votes.\
\
Rewards are distributed every second to staked tokens.\
\
Reward rates will be evaluated each month and may be subjected to changes. Any modifications will be announced at least 7 days in advance before being implemented.
