### Phase I - Decentralized Autonomous Organization <a href="#phase-2-decentralized-autonomous-organization" id="phase-2-decentralized-autonomous-organization"></a>

A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a type of digital organization that is run using smart contracts and blockchain technology. In a DAO, users can use MINE tokens to participate in the decision-making process by voting on proposals and potentially even creating new proposals if their holdings of MINE tokens are sufficient. Users can earn MINE tokens by participating in the DAO in various ways, such as by contributing to the development of the organization or by providing valuable services to the community. The more MINE tokens a user holds, the more influence they may have in the decision-making process. To vote on proposals, users can use their MINE tokens to cast a vote in favor or opposition to a particular proposal. The outcome of the vote is determined by the total number of MINE tokens held by users who voted on the proposal. If a user's holdings of MINE tokens are above a certain threshold, they may be able to create their own proposals and submit them to the DAO for consideration. In a DAO, decisions are made in a decentralized manner, meaning that there is no central authority dictating the actions of the organization. This can provide a level of transparency and accountability, as all decisions and votes are recorded on the blockchain and can be publicly audited.

### Phase II - TBA
