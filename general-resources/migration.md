# ðŸ•Š Migration

If you burned your STR and veSTR tokens and NFT on Arbitrum during the eligible burn period, you don't have to do anything.\*\*\
\
We will be airdroping the MINE and allMINE tokens to all the burners on day 1. \
\
The burn ratio is set as follows:\


1. One veSTR = 4 allMINE
2. One STR = 1 MINE + 0.5 allMINE

### Escrowed MINE (allMINE)

When you receive your Escrowed MINE (allMINE) after the migration, you can use them in two ways:\
\
1\. Staking them for rewards; similar to regular MINE tokens.\
2\. Vesting them to become actual MINE tokens over a period of one year\
\
Each staked Escrowed MINE (allMINE) token will earn the same amount of Escrowed MINE and ETH rewards as a regular MINE token.

### Vesting

Escrowed MINE (allMINE) tokens can be converted into MINE tokens through vesting, this can be accessed on the Earn page.\
\
After initiating vesting, the allMINE tokens will be converted into MINE every second and will fully vest over 365 days. allMINE tokens that have been converted into MINE are claimable at anytime.\
\
allMINE tokens that have been unstaked and deposited for **vesting will not earn rewards.** Staked tokens that are reserved for vesting will continue to earn rewards.\
\
Tokens that are reserved for vesting cannot be unstaked or sold. To unreserve the tokens, use the "Withdraw" button on the Earn page. Partial withdrawals are not supported, so withdrawing will withdraw and unreserve all tokens as well as pause vesting. All escrowed MINE (allMINE) tokens that had been vested into MINE will remain as MINE tokens.
