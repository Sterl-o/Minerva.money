# ðŸ•Š Migration

If you burned your STR and veSTR tokens and NFT on Arbitrum during the eligible burn period, you don't have to do anything.\*\*\
\
We will be airdroping the MINE and allMINE tokens to all the burners on day 1. \
\
The burn ratio is set as follows:\


1. One veSTR = 4 allMINE
2. One STR = 1 MINE + 0.5 allMINE

### Escrowed MINE (allMINE)

When you receive your Escrowed MINE (allMINE) after the migration, you can use them in two ways:\
\
1\. Staking them for rewards; similar to regular MINE tokens.\
2\. Vesting them to become actual MINE tokens over a period of one year\
\
Each staked Escrowed MINE (allMINE) token will earn the same amount of Escrowed MINE and ETH rewards as a regular MINE token.\
\
For a more information on allMINE, check out [rewards.md](../core-features/rewards.md "mention")\
\
\*\*If you missed the burn period, please open a ticket on Discord.&#x20;
