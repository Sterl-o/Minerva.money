### Escrowed MINE (allMINE)

Escrowed MINE (allMINE) can be used in two ways:\
\
1\. Staked for rewards similar to regular MINE tokens.\
2\. Vested to become actual MINE tokens over a period of one year\
\
Each staked Escrowed MINE (allMINE) token will earn the same amount of Escrowed MINE and ETH rewards as a regular MINE token.\
\
Note that Escrowed MINE (allMINE) is not meant to be transferrable unless you are doing a full account transfer. The amount of MINE or MLP required to vest allMINE is unique per account and capped to the rewards received by that account. Please do not buy allMINE off the market or OTC as you will not be able to vest them.
