### **Staking**

Staked MINE receives three types of rewards:\
\
\- escrowed MINE (allMINE)\
\- Multiplier Points\
\- ETH \
\
For more info on Escrowed MINE (allMINE) and Multiplier Points, please see the Rewards page.\
\
30% of fees generated from swaps and leverage trading are converted to ETH and distributed to staked MINE tokens. Note that the fees distributed are based on the number after deducting referral rewards and the network costs of[ keepers,](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] keeper costs are usually around 1% of the total fees.

### Floor Price Fund (_Coming soon_)

_The MINE token has a floor price fund in ETH and MLP. It grows in two ways:_\
\
_- MINE/ETH liquidity is provided and owned by the protocol, the fees from this trading pair will be converted to MLP and deposited into the floor price fund_\
\
_- 50% of funds received through Olympus bonds are sent to the floor price fund, the other 50% is used for marketing._\
\
_The floor price fund helps to ensure liquidity in MLP and provide a reliable stream of ETH rewards for all staked MINE._\
\
_As the floor price fund grows, it can also be used to buyback and burn MINE if the (Floor Price Fund) / (Total Supply of MINE) is less than the market price, this would lead to a minimum price for MINE in terms of ETH and MLP._\
\
_The current floor price fund is held in multiple contracts, these will be gradually consolidated into a single contract:_\
\
_If required, the floor price fund may be used to pay for Bug Bounty submissions._

### Supply

The supply of MINE can be viewed on the Dashboard.\
\
The increase in circulating supply will vary depending on the number of tokens that get vested, and the amount of tokens used for marketing / partnerships. The forecasted max supply is 13.25 million MINE tokens.\
\
Minting beyond the max supply of 13.25 million is controlled by a 28 day timelock. This option will only be used if more products are launched and liquidity mining is required, a governance vote will be conducted before any changes.\
\
MINE liquidity on Velodrome is gradually added as the price of MINE increases, the MINE liquidity pool is at **\<insert LP ADDRESS>**\
\
Liquidity is owned by the protocol and stored under the same multi-sig signers following the [Sterling.finance](https://sterling.finance/) migration.
